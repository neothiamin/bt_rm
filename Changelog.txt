1.3.2:

+++ Many thanks to Dub for playtesting an beta version of this release for me!

+ Added a new event for Catholic nations converting Waldensian provinces
+ Added a new Cathar-related event for the owner of Firenze/Florence
+ Added a new Lollard event about possible abuse of church assets
+ Added a new Clergy Agenda for Cathar and Waldensians - Seek Alliance with Spiritual Brethren
+ Added a new Clergy estate privilege for Waldensians - Organizational Reform
+ Added a new Clergy estate privilege for Lollards - Grant Bible Translation Exclusivity
+ Added the new North Wesphalia area to the list of areas eligible for secondary Cathar Centers of Reformation
+ New color for Coptic

* Removed Heresy events from on_actions and returned them to their mean-time-to-happen roots
* Added Heretical Susceptibility, a modifier that gives -50% Resistance to Reformation on a province level and increases the likelihood that the province will be targeted by a Center of Reformation
* Raised Center of Reformation conversion rates
* Fixed some potential issues with Lollard province conversions
* Provinces with cardinals are now less likely to be targeted by Centers of Reformation
* The "Establishment of new Bishopric in (province)" event now has a tooltip indicating the addition of the Cathar Bishopric modifier
* The "Forced Conversion" modifier now lasts 5 years instead of 2
* Provinces with the "Forced Conversion" modifier will now not be targeted by Waldensian, Cathar, or Lollard Centers of Reformation

- Lollard nations cannot convert back to Catholic anymore, since England was often converting via event and then converting right back

1.3.1.1:

* Updated dependencies

1.3.1:

* Updated to BT 13 for EU4 1.30
* Fixed a bug with the Commission Bible Translation decision
* Migrated many events from province_events to country_events triggered by on_actions
* Added "goto" lines for many events
* Removed "Hussite" and "Lollard" from Catholic rebel heresy names, since those actually exist now
* Refined Center of Reformation province weighting (basically the game's logic for which provinces to choose to convert), maximum distance for converted provinces, and conversion speed
	- Cathar Center of Reformation conversion speed dropped from 2.5%/month base to 1.5%/month base, and Cathar Centers of Reformation now only convert provinces within 100 distance units
	- Waldensian Centers of Reformation conversion speed dropped to 1%/month base and many province weighting bonuses were removed, such as bonus weight for Waldensian countries' provinces, provinces of the same culture as the Center's province, and provinces in the same culture group as the Center's province
	- Lollard Center/s of Reformation now convert at 2.5%/month base, but Lollard nations' provinces no longer get bonus weight for Center of Reformation targeting
* More English provinces will get converted to Lollard if England either lets the Lollards exist or decides to take up the Lollard cross, to facilitate easier conversion and to account for the added English provinces in BT 13
