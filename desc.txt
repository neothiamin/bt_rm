[h1]Overview[/h1]

Are you a heretic? Do you long for the good ol' days before the Albigensian Crusade? Do you HATE the Church, but don't want to write your 95 reasons why? Do you love C H A O S?!

Then this mod is for you!

Heresy! is an addon for Beyond Typus that adds/will add many new heresies, primarily those that went against the Catholic Church. 

[b]Added Heresies[/b]
[list]
[*]Catharism
[*]Waldensianism
[*]Lollardy
[/list]

Heresies can be enabled one by one at the start of the game. In addition, each Heresy has a certain set of provinces that it can begin in, such as Occitania for Catharism or Piedmont for Waldensianism. Lollardy spawns when the vanilla "The Lollard Heresy" event occurs for England, and only if Lollardy is enabled via the Enable Lollardy decision.

[b]Requirements[/b]
This mod requires Beyond Typus to work properly. It will technically work without Beyond Typus, but I will not provide support for anyone who does not use Beyond Typus with Heresy. This mod is made with Beyond Typus in mind, and the "intended" experience is to play it alongside Beyond Typus.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
Heresy is incompatible with any mods that do the following:
[olist]
[*]Change religion icons (with one exception, explained later)
[*]Add new religions (with one exception, again, explained later)
[*]Change the colors of the Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, or Coptic religions
[*]Change, adds to, or removes the allowed_conversion sections of the Catholic, Protestant, or Anglican religions
[*]Change either the Anglican_events.txt file or the FlavorENG.txt file in the /events folder
[*]Change the 01_church.txt files in /common/estates, with one exception.
[/olist]

The exception to items 1 and 2 is the mod Pagan Wrath, which was made to be compatible with Heresy out-of-the-proverbial-box. Compatibility with other mods that do any of the items listed above is not guaranteed.
The exception to item 6 is Dub's Byzantine Resurgence, which I have added compatibility for.

[b]Other Notes[/b]
I have added localization for French, Spanish, and German to prevent localization keys being displayed in place of localized text. The text is identical to the English localization because I do not speak French, Spanish, or German. If you would like to contribute translations for these languages, please reach out to me!

Enjoy!
