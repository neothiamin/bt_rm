Are you a heretic? Do you long for the good ol' days before the Albigensian Crusade? Do you HATE the Church, but don't want to write your 95 reasons why? Do you love C H A O S?!

Then this mod is for you!

Heresy! is an addon for Beyond Typus that adds/will add many new heresies, primarily those that went against the Catholic Church. At the moment, it adds only one new religion, Catharism, but others such as Fraticellianism, Waldensianism, and more are planned.

This mod requires both Beyond Typus and Dub's BT addon, Bugfixing BT 12.0. It probably could work without BT, but I will not provide support for non-BT users.

Enjoy!
