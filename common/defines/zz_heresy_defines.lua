NDefines.NDiplomacy.HRE_HERETIC_PENALTY = -0.003 -- Per heretic prince (halved by Peace of Westphalia) --Reduced from 0p01 because heretic princes are a lot more common earlier in Heresy
NDefines.NReligion.MAX_CHRISTIAN_RELIGIOUS_CENTERS = 3			-- BTAddOn changed from 3   Compensating for more provinces and more tags   Ive seen too many games with only 3 protestant and reformed countries because all CoR hit in the same area   Apparently doesnt work leaving it anyway --Heresy - changed back to 3 because of busted localization
