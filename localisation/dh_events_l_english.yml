 #Cathar Events
 dh_albi.1.t:0 "Cathar Resurgence"
 dh_albi.1.desc:0 "It would appear that the Cathars, also known as Albigensians, are back at it again. Despite the Albigensian Crusade waged o so long ago, the general societal disdain towards them, the acknowledgement of their issues with the Church, generous syncretism, slight appeasement....\n\nAnyways, the Cathars are back, and this time they seem more stubborn than ever."
 dh_albi.1.a:0 "Not again..."

 dh_albi.2.t:0 "Cathar Center"
 dh_albi.2.desc:0 "A group of devout Cathars has begun spreading their faith in [Root.GetName]! Their flock grows by the day."
 dh_albi.2.a:0 "Blast!"

 dh_albi.3.t:0 "Mass Conversions in Toulouse"
 dh_albi.3.desc:0 "Toulouse has historically been the epicenter of the Cathar menace. The Albigensian Crusade, waged in the early years of the 13th century, took place almost entirely within the southern part of our realm, and dragged on for years and years. The memories of the Crusade are still fresh in the minds of the Occitan people, who are yet often called \"Cathars\" by others regardless of their actual faith. It is no surprise then that when the Cathar Resurgence began, many Occitans flocked to the banner of Catharism. A wave of mass conversion is taking place currently in Toulouse, and it does not seem like it will end any time soon."
 dh_albi.3.a:0 "No!"
 dh_mass_conversions_in_toulouse.tt:0 "Mass conversions take place in and around Toulouse."
 
 dh_albi.4.t:0 "Den of Heresy"
 dh_albi.4.desc:0 "Practicers of minority religions tend to gather together in secluded or isolated places. Alleyways, a member's home, places where no one wants to go, etc. However, the Cathars in [Root.GetName] have recently been gathering and performing their rites and rituals in a rather public place - a local inn! Naturally, the faithful in [Root.GetName] are rather upset about this, and are demanding the Crown do something about the heretics in their midst."
 dh_albi.4.a:0 "Stamp this out!"
 dh_albi.4.b:0 "Let the people gather where they like."
 dh_albi.4.c:0 "The Church will handle this."
 dh_albi.4.d:0 "Send in the Inquisitors!"
 
 dh_albi.5.t:0 "New Bishopric in [Root.GetName]"
 dh_albi.5.desc:0 "My [Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]! Our piety has been recognized and, after the occurrence of a Council in [Owner.Capital.GetName], a new Bishopric has been established in [Root.GetName]!"
 dh_albi.5.a:0 "Splendid!"

 dh_albi.6.t:0 "Accusations of Greed"
 dh_albi.6.desc:0 "One of the key tenets of Cathar belief is the rejection of all things borne of the material world, which is evil. Many Cathars practice devout asceticism as a rule, and believe that those who cling to their possessions are sinful. Unfortunately, it seems that now the lens of criticism has been focused on [Root.Monarch.GetName], and many devotees are accusing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] of being greedy."
 dh_albi.6.a:0 "Preposterous!"
 dh_albi.6.b:0 "We must cast away material possessions if we are to be saved."

 dh_albi.8.t:0 "Revivalists in Lombardy"
 dh_albi.8.desc:0 "REPLACE_ME"
 dh_albi.8.a:0 "Cast them out!"
 dh_waldo_8_b_tt:0 "Every non-§YCenter of Reformation§! province in §YUpper Lombardy§! and §YLower Lombardy§! owned by §YMilan§! has a §R25%§! chance to become §YCathar.§!"
 dh_albi.8.b:0 "Accept them as brothers in faith."

 #Waldensian Events
 dh_waldo.1.t:0 "Waldensian Mission Discovered in [Root.GetName]"
 dh_waldo.1.desc:0 "The Waldensians, also known as the \"Poor of Lyons\" or \"Poor Men,\" have existed in some form or another for centuries. Recently, though, state inquisitors have discovered a sizeable congregation of Waldensians in [Root.GetName]. As part of their faith, Waldensians are dedicated missionaries, and will spread their faith wherever they believe they will find converts."
 dh_waldo.1.a:0 "Surely they will keep to themselves, right?"

 dh_waldo.2.t:0 "Waldensians from the Woodwork"
 dh_waldo.2.desc:0 "Evidently, the discovery of the Waldensian mission in [dh_waldo_spawn_prov.GetName] has inspired the underground Waldensian community in [Root.GetName] to start preaching in public! Laymen dressed in robes and hoods are stood at every other street corner in [Root.Capital.GetName], preaching about God knows what."
 dh_waldo.2.a:0 "They're everywhere!"

 dh_waldo.3.t:0 "Popularity Among the Poor"
 dh_waldo.3.desc:0 "Waldensians are notorious for their advocacy of lay preaching, or the ability for non-clergymen to give sermons and perform ceremonial rites. Waldensians are also notorious for their love of the poor. Naturally, when these two characteristics mix, events undesirable to a pious Catholic nation like ours may occur.\n\nLately, the Waldensian community in [Root.GetName] have been utilizing the... \"humility,\" let's say, of the local populace in regards to their material possessions as fodder for their sermons, and many locals have taken to believing them. If we let this lay preaching continue on unabated, this trend may spread to our other lands."
 dh_waldo.3.a:0 "Let them practice in peace."
 dh_waldo.3.b:0 "Crack down on it!"
 dh_waldo.3.c:0 "These Waldensians may have a point. Help to alleviate the poverty of these people."
