 cathar_religion_desc:0 "Catharism is a dualist sect which arose in the early years of the 11th century and which found great success in southern France and northern Italy until the 14th century. Catharism, from the Greek \"katharoi\" meaning \"pure ones,\" identified two diametrically opposed forces or deities: the \"good\" God, depicted in the New Testament, who created the spirit; and the \"evil\" God, depicted in the Old Testament, who created all matter and was often associated with Satan. Due to the connection between material possession and the Devil, many Cathars adopted an ascetic lifestyle. Cathars were also unique due to their tolerance of women, including the ability for a woman to perform the \"consolamentum,\" one of the sacraments integral to Cathar theology. Cathars' beliefs were considered heretical by the Catholic Church, which declared the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in 1208, ultimately leading to the eradication of the sect by the mid-1300s."

 waldensian_religion_desc:0 "Founded in the late 12th century, Waldensians are followers of the teachings of Peter Vaudès, a spiritual leader from Lyon, France. Waldensians are anti-clerical, and advocate a return to vows of poverty coupled with the practice of lay preaching, or preaching by people not designated as members of the clergy. Waldensians, unlike other contemporary movements like the Cathars, survived for centuries after the initial foundation of their belief system, and are considered to be one of the primary inspirations of the Protestant Reformation."
